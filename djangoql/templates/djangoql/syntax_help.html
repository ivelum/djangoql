    <div class="module">
      <h2 id="search-conditions">Search conditions</h2>
      <p>
        A search condition is a basic search query building block. It always
        consists of 3 elements: <code>field</code>,
        <code>comparison operator</code> and <code>value</code>, placed exactly
        in this order from left to right.
      </p>
      {% block search_condition_examples %}
        <p>
          Here's an example - looking for users with first name "John". In the
          example below <code>first_name</code> is a <code>field</code>,
          <code>=</code> is a <code>comparison operator</code> and
          <code>"John"</code> is a <code>value</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>first_name = "John"</pre>
        <p>
          Another example, looking for users who registered in 2017 or later:
        </p>
        <pre>date_joined >= "2017-01-01"</pre>
        <p>One more example, looking for super-users:</p>
        <pre>is_superuser = True</pre>
        <p>And one more - finding all users whose names are in a given list:</p>
        <pre>first_name in ("John", "Jack", "Jason")</pre>
      {% endblock %}
    </div>
  {% endblock %}

  {% block multiple_search_conditions %}
    <div class="module">
      <h2 id="multiple-search-conditions">Multiple search conditions</h2>

      <p>
        You can combine multiple search conditions together using the logical
        operators <code>and</code> (both conditions must be true) and
        <code>or</code> (at least one of the conditions must be true, no matter
        which one). Important - logical operators must be written in lowercase:
        <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> is correct, and <code>AND</code> or
        <code>OR</code> is incorrect and will cause an error.
      </p>

      {% block multiple_search_condition_examples %}
        <p>
          Example: looking for users with first name "John" <code>and</code>
          registered in 2017 or later. Please note that we have 2 search
          conditions here, joined with <code>and</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>first_name = "John" and date_joined >= "2017-01-01"</pre>
        <p>
          One more example, looking for users who are either super-users
          <code>or</code> marked with "Staff" flag:
        </p>
        <pre>is_superuser = True or is_staff = True</pre>
        <p>
          Logical operators can be quite powerful, as they let you to build
          complex search queries. If you're building a complex query there's an
          important tip to keep in mind: if your query contains both
          <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators, we strongly encourage
          you to use parenthesis to specify the precedence of operators. Here's
          an example to illustrate why this is important. Let's assume that you
          want to pull users who are either super-users <code>or</code> marked
          with Staff flag, <code>and</code> registered in 2017 or later. It
          might be tempting to write a query like this:
        </p>
        <pre>is_superuser = True or is_staff = True and date_joined > "2017-01-01"</pre>
        <p>
          The problem with the query above is that it won't do what you expect,
          because the <code>and</code> operator is evaluated first. In fact it pulls
          users who are either super-users (no matter when they registered)
          <code>or</code> users who are both Staff <code>and</code> registered
          after 2017. This problem can be fixed with parentheses, just put them
          around the search conditions that must be evaluated first, like this:
        </p>
        <pre>(is_superuser = True or is_staff = True) and date_joined > "2017-01-01"</pre>
        <p>
          Using parenthesis is recommended only when your query mixes both
          <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators. If your query contains
          multiple logical operators of only one kind (either <code>and</code>
          or <code>or</code>) you can safely omit parenthesis and it will work
          as expected.

  {% block fields %}
    <div class="module">
      <h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>

      <p>
        In a search query, you should reference the current model's fields
        exactly as they're defined in Python code for that particular Django
        model. Search query input has an auto-completion feature that pops up
        automatically and suggests all available options. If you're not sure
        what the field name is, then pick one of the options displayed
        (example):
      </p>

          src="{% static 'djangoql/img/completion_example.png' %}"

          alt="DjangoQL completion example">
      {% endblock %}

      {% block field_naming %}
      <p>
        In most cases, internal Django model fields look similar to what you see
        in Django admin interface, just in lowercase and with <code>_</code>
        instead of spaces. For example, in the standard Users admin interface,
        the internal <code>first_name</code> field is displayed as
        <code>First name</code>, <code>email</code> field is displayed as
        <code>Email address</code> and so on. However there could be exceptions
        to this, if developers have defined custom display names that look
        very different from their internal representation. In such cases it
        might be a good idea to ask developers to override this help template
        and provide an "internal name -> display name" fields mapping right
        here.
      </p>
      {% endblock %}

      <p>
        Note that some fields that you see in Django admin may not be
        searchable. This includes computed fields, i.e. fields which are not
        stored in the database as a plain value, but rather calculated from
        other values in the code.
      </p>
    </div>
  {% endblock %}

  {% block related_models %}
    <div class="module">
      <h2 id="related-models">Related models</h2>

      <p>
        DjangoQL allows you to search by related models as well (it
        automatically converts relations to SQL joins under the hood). Use the
        <code>.</code> dot separator to designate related models and their
        fields. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>groups.name in ("Marketing", "Support")</pre>

      <p>
        See the <code>.</code> in the example above? It means that
        <code>groups</code> is a related model and <code>name</code> is a field
        of that model. As usual, DjangoQL auto-completion provides suggestions
        for all available related models and their fields. For complex data
        structures you can use multiple levels of relation, i.e. specifying a
        related model, then its related model, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        In most cases the search condition with a related model must specify the
        exact field of that model, but not a related model itself. For example,
        <code>groups in ("Marketing", "Support")</code> won't work, because
        <code>groups</code> is a model and not a field. Models can have many
        fields, and the server doesn't know against which field you would like
        to perform a comparison. However there's one notable exception to
        this - when you'd like to find records that are linked (or not linked)
        to any related models of that kind. In such a case, you should compare
        the related model to a special <code>None</code> value, like this:
      </p>

      <pre>groups = None</pre>

      <p>
        The example above would search for users that don't belong to any
        groups. If you'd like to find all users that belong to at least any
        group instead, use <code>!= None</code>:
      </p>

      <pre>groups != None</pre>
